		<h1>Warriors of thr world</h1>
		<p>Here our soldiers stand from all around the world<br>
		   wainting in a line to hear the battle cry<br>
		   all are gathered here  victoryis near<br>
		   the sound will fill the hall bringing power to us all<br>
		   we alone are fighting for meatl that is true<br>
		   we own the right to live the fight we're here for all of you<br>
		   now swear the blood upon your steel will never dry<br>
		   stand and fight together beneath the metal sky<br></p>
		   <br>
		<p>Brother erverywhere<br>
		   raise your hands into the air<br>
		   we're warriors<br>
		   warriors of the world<br>
		   like thunder from the sky<br>
		   sworn to fight and die<br>
		   we're warriors<br>
		   warriors of the world.<br></p>
		   <br>
		<p>Many stand against us but they will never win<br>
		   we said we would returnand here we are again<br>
		   to bring them all destruction, suffering and pain<br>
		   we are the hammer of the gods we are thunder wind and rain<br>
		   there thet wait in fear with sword in feeble hands<br>
		   with dreams to be a king first one should be a man<br>
		   I call them out and charge them all with a life that is a liee<br>
		   and in their final hour they shall confess before they die<br></p>
		   <br>
		<p>Brother everywhere<br>
		   raise your hands into the air<br>
		   we're warriors<br>
		   warriors of the world<br>
		   like thunder from the sky<br>
		   sworn to fight and die<br>
		   we're warriors<br>
		   warriors of the world<br></p>
